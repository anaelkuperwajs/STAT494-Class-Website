I made a Shiny App!

The dataset in this app is called 'lending_club', which represents an American peer-to-peer lending company. I used stacking to generate a "super" predictor for the outcome Class (either good or bad). This shiny app allows you to input values for all the variables in the model, and see the predicted outcome! Enjoy!
